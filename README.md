# Salt Dash

Read-only web interface to read from Salt's [external job cache](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jobs/external_cache.html) using the  [`pgjsonb`](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/returners/all/salt.returners.pgjsonb.html) returner.

## Running Locally

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for building the front-end.

Install [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) for the back-end.

```bash
make all
pipenv shell
saltdash migrate
saltdash runserver
```

## Client-side Development

Currently using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/). To start a development environment with live reloading, run:

```bash
cd client
yarn run watch
```

## Running in Production

`saltdash runserver` is not suitable for production. A production-level
webserver is included and can be started with `saltdash serve`. If Docker is
more your speed, there's a `Dockerfile` as well.

### Configuration

Configuration can be done via environment variables, a file, or a combination
of both thanks to [`Goodconf`](https://pypi.org/project/goodconf/). By default
it will look for a YAML file named `saltdash.yml` in `/etc/saltdash/` or the current
directory. You can also specify a configuration file with the `-C` or `--config`
flags. `saltdash-generate-config` can be used to generate a sample config file
containing the following variables:

* **DEBUG**
  Enable debugging.
  type: `bool`
* **SECRET_KEY**  _REQUIRED_
  a long random string you keep secret https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/settings/#secret-key
  type: `str`
* **DATABASE_URL**
  type: `str`
  default: `postgres://localhost:5432/salt`
* **ALLOWED_HOSTS**
  Hosts allowed to serve the site https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts
  type: `list`
  default: `['*']`
* **GITHUB_TEAM_ID**
  type: `str`
* **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID**
  type: `str`
* **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET**
  type: `str`
* **SENTRY_DSN**
  type: `str`
* **LISTEN**
  Socket for webserver to listen on.
  type: `str`
  default: `127.0.0.1:8077`

GitHub Team authentication is included by setting the relevant `GITHUB_*` variables.

You'll need to setup an OAuth App at `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/applications` with a callback URL in the form: `https://your-site.example.com/auth/complete/github-team/`

To retrieve your team IDs:

1. Create [a token at GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. `curl -H "Authorization: token <token>" https://api.github.com/orgs/<org>/teams`



## Setting up Salt

Once you've setup a Postgresql database using `saltdash migrate`, connect Salt's external job cache to the database by adding the following lines to `/etc/salt/master.d/job_cache.conf`:

```ini
# Replace items in brackets with actual values
master_job_cache: pgjsonb
returner.pgjsonb.host: [db-host]
returner.pgjsonb.pass: [db-password]
returner.pgjsonb.db: [db-database-name]
returner.pgjsonb.port: [db-port]
returner.pgjsonb.user: [db-user]
```

Restart your `salt-master` and all future jobs should get stored in the database.

If you have *lots* of jobs, you'll probably want to purge the cache periodically. A helper command is provided to do just that, run:

```bash
saltdash purge_job_cache [days_older_than_to_purge]
```

If you want to automate this, use the `--no-input` flag to bypass the confirmation prompt.
