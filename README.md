# Salt Dash

Read-only web interface to read from Salt's [external job cache](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jobs/external_cache.html) using the  [`pgjsonb`](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/returners/all/salt.returners.pgjsonb.html) returner.

## Development

### Pre-requisites

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for building the front-end.
* [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) for the back-end.
* A Postgresql database

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lincolnloop/saltdash.git
cd saltdash
make all              # download dependencies and build the world
$EDITOR saltdash.yml  # change settings as needed
poetry shell          # activate the Python virtual environment
saltdash migrate      # setup the database
saltdash runserver    # run a development server
```

### Client-side

Uses [parcel](https://parceljs.org/). To start a development environment with live reloading, run:

```bash
cd client
yarn run watch
```

## Running in Production

```bash
pip install saltdash
```

`saltdash runserver` is not suitable for production. A production-level
webserver is included and can be started with `saltdash serve`. If Docker is
more your speed, there's a `Dockerfile` as well.

⚠️ The built-in webserver does not handle HTTPS. The default settings assume the
app is deployed behind a proxy which is terminating HTTPS connections and
properly handling headers. If this is not the case, [you should read this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#secure-proxy-ssl-header) and take appropriate actions.

### Configuration

Configuration can be done via environment variables, a file, or a combination
of both thanks to [`Goodconf`](https://pypi.org/project/goodconf/). By default
it will look for a YAML file named `saltdash.yml` in `/etc/saltdash/` or the current
directory. You can also specify a configuration file with the `-C` or `--config`
flags. `saltdash-generate-config` can be used to generate a sample config file
containing the following variables:

* **DEBUG**  
  Enable debugging.  
  type: `bool`  
* **SECRET_KEY**  _REQUIRED_  
  a long random string you keep secret https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#secret-key  
  type: `str`  
* **DATABASE_URL**  
  type: `str`  
  default: `postgres://localhost:5432/salt`  
* **ALLOWED_HOSTS**  
  Hosts allowed to serve the site https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts  
  type: `list`  
  default: `['*']`  
* **HIDE_OUTPUT**  
  List of modules to hide the output from in the web interface.  
  type: `list`  
  default: `['pillar.*']`
* **GITHUB_TEAM_ID**  
  type: `str`  
* **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID**  
  type: `str`  
* **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET**  
  type: `str`  
* **SENTRY_DSN**  
  type: `str`  
* **LISTEN**  
  Socket for webserver to listen on.  
  type: `str`  
  default: `127.0.0.1:8077`  

GitHub Team authentication is included by setting the relevant `GITHUB_*` variables.

You'll need to setup an OAuth App at `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/applications` with a callback URL in the form: `https://your-site.example.com/auth/complete/github-team/`

To retrieve your team IDs:

1. Create [a token at GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. `curl -H "Authorization: token <token>" https://api.github.com/orgs/<org>/teams`



## Setting up Salt

Once you've setup a Postgresql database using `saltdash migrate`, connect Salt's external job cache to the database by adding the following lines to `/etc/salt/master.d/job_cache.conf`:

```ini
# Replace items in brackets with actual values
master_job_cache: pgjsonb
returner.pgjsonb.host: [db-host]
returner.pgjsonb.pass: [db-password]
returner.pgjsonb.db: [db-database-name]
returner.pgjsonb.port: [db-port]
returner.pgjsonb.user: [db-user]
```

Restart your `salt-master` and all future jobs should get stored in the database.

If you have *lots* of jobs, you'll probably want to purge the cache periodically. A helper command is provided to do just that, run:

```bash
saltdash purge_job_cache [days_older_than_to_purge]
```

If you want to automate this, use the `--no-input` flag to bypass the confirmation prompt.

## Protecting Secrets

It is very easy to accidentally expose secrets in Salt via the logs and/or
console output. The same applies for Saltdash. Since secrets are often stored
in encrypted pillar data, by default the output from any `pillar.*` calls is
hidden via the `HIDE_OUTPUT` setting. If you have additional modules you know
expose secret data, they should be added to the list.

There are many other ways secrets can leak, however. A few general tips (which
are good practice whether you use Saltdash or not).

* Set `show_changes: false` on any `file.*` actions which deal with sensitive data.
* Set `hide_output: true` on any `cmd.*` state which may output sensitive data.
* When working with files, use templates or `pillar_contents` when appropriate.
* Avoid passing secrets as arguments to modules or states. Typically Salt can
  read them from a pillar or config instead.
